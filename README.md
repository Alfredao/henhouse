Hen House NFT Game
=============================

Hen House is an NFT based game, a metaverse farming experience that brings the joys of raising and breeding hens! In this game, you get to take care of your own digital hen house and collect eggs laid by the hens you raise.

Just like in a real farm, you start by opening eggs and summoning hens. Each hen is unique NFT item and can be black, white or brown, and has its own specific characteristics such as productivity, endurance, strength, stamina and health. 
You can then place your hens in digital hen houses and use them to create more eggs. The more productive and healthy your hens are, the more eggs you will collect!

One of the fun parts of the game is that you can trade and sell your hens with other players in the marketplace, using the in-game currency HEN. The game also has a time limit, so you have to make sure to collect your eggs before they rot after 14 days.

Just like in a real farm, the goal is to become the best farmer you can be by taking care of your hens and collecting as many eggs as you can. Join us now and start your journey to become the ultimate Hen House NFT Game farmer!

This game is a great way for kids to learn about the basics of farming, raising hens and collecting eggs in a fun and interactive way.
